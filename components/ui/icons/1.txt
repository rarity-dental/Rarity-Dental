At Rarity Dental Care Centre in Delhi, we are committed to providing our patients with the best possible dental care using the latest advancements in dental technology. One such revolutionary technology is the 3D CBCT Scan, a cutting-edge imaging technique that offers unparalleled precision and clarity in dental diagnostics and treatment planning.
What is a 3D CBCT Scan?
A 3D CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) scan is a specialised type of dental CT scan that creates detailed 3D images of your teeth, soft tissues, nerve pathways, and bone. Unlike traditional dental X-rays, a 3D CBCT scan provides a comprehensive view of your oral and maxillofacial region, allowing for more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans.
Why Choose a 3D CBCT Scan?
Precision and Accuracy: The 3D CBCT scan offers a high level of accuracy, which is crucial for procedures like dental implants, root canal treatments, and orthodontics. It provides clear and precise images that help in identifying the exact location and condition of teeth and surrounding structures.
Comprehensive View: Unlike traditional 2D X-rays, the 3D CBCT scan provides a complete and detailed view of the entire oral and maxillofacial region. This comprehensive view is essential for detecting complex dental issues that might be missed with standard X-rays.
Efficient and Quick: The 3D CBCT scan is a quick procedure that takes only a few minutes. The images are available immediately, allowing for faster diagnosis and treatment planning.
Better Treatment Outcomes: With the detailed and accurate images provided by the 3D CBCT scan, dental professionals can plan and execute treatments with greater precision, leading to better and more predictable outcomes.
Reduced Radiation Exposure: Although any CT scan involves exposure to radiation, the 3D CBCT scan uses a lower dose compared to traditional CT scans, making it a safer option for patients.
